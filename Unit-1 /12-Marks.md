# **Social Networking Security Exam Preparation**

## **1. Transition from Current Web to Semantic Web**

**Definition:** The **Semantic Web** is an extension of the current web that adds meaning (**semantic meaning**) to data through **machine-readable metadata**, enabling computers to understand and process information intelligently without human intervention.

**Key Technologies:** **RDF (Resource Description Framework)** for data modeling, **OWL (Web Ontology Language)** for defining relationships, and **SPARQL** for querying semantic data.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph LR
A[Current Web] --> B[Documents]
B --> C{Human Interpretation}
C --> D[Limited Automation]
A --> E[Semantic Web]
E --> F[Structured Data]
F --> G{Machine Understanding}
G --> H[Automated Reasoning]
```

**Real-World Case:** In healthcare, **semantic interoperability** enables different EHR systems to exchange and interpret patient data accurately. During COVID-19, semantic technologies allowed for **integrated patient care** across different healthcare providers, reducing medical errors and avoiding duplicate entries.

**Countermeasures:** Develop **domain-specific ontologies**, implement **RDF standardization**, and use **SPARQL endpoints** for unified data access.

**References:** 
1. Semantic Interoperability in Health Records (PMC8791650)

## **3. Network Centrality in Digital Marketing**

**Definition:** **Network centrality** measures the importance of nodes (users) in a social network based on their **connection patterns**, helping identify **key influencers** for targeted marketing.

**Key Metrics:** **Degree centrality** (number of direct connections), **betweenness centrality** (role as a bridge), and **closeness centrality** (proximity to all other nodes).

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD
A[Influencer] -->|Degree| B[Many Direct Ties]
C[Broker] -->|Betweenness| D[Bridges Groups]
E[Broadcaster] -->|Closeness| F[Quick Access to Network]
```

**Real-World Case:** A digital campaign for a health coalition used **degree centrality** to identify partners with the most connections for leadership roles, **betweenness centrality** to find information brokers, and **closeness centrality** to identify rapid information disseminators.

**Countermeasures:** Use **SNA tools** like PARTNER CPRM to calculate centrality metrics and **diversify influencer selection** to avoid over-reliance on single nodes.

**References:** 
1. Network Centrality Measures (Visible Network Labs)

    Platform Consolidation : 2020-FTC vs Facebook
```

**Real-World Case:** The **Cambridge Analytica scandal (2018)** involved unauthorized harvesting of **87 million Facebook users** data for political profiling, highlighting risks of **third-party data access** and **insufficient consent mechanisms**.

**Countermeasures:** Implement **comprehensive data protection laws** (e.g., GDPR), enforce **antitrust regulations** to prevent monopolistic data consolidation, and promote **privacy-by-design** architectures.

**References:** 
1. Social Media Privacy (EPIC.org)
2. Evolution of Social Media Algorithms (Multipost Digital)

**Practice Questions:**
1. How did the Cambridge Analytica scandal change perceptions of social media privacy?
2. Propose two strategies to reduce privacy risks from surveillance advertising.

## **5. Comparing Network Structures for Information Flow**

**Definition:** **Network efficiency** is measured by how quickly information spreads through a structure, using **centrality metrics** to compare alternative architectures.

**Key Metrics:** **Degree centrality** (direct influence), **betweenness centrality** (brokerage capacity), and **closeness centrality** (efficient dissemination).

**Comparison Table:**
| **Metric** | **Scale-Free Network** | **Small-World Network** |
|------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Degree Centrality** | High (hubs) | Moderate (uniform) |
| **Betweenness Centrality** | Concentrated on hubs | Evenly distributed |
| **Closeness Centrality** | Variable (high for hubs) | High for all nodes |
| **Info Flow Efficiency** | Rapid but hub-dependent | Balanced and resilient |

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph A[Scale-Free Network]
  A1[Hub] --> A2[Node 1]
  A1 --> A3[Node 2]
  A1 --> A4[Node 3]
end
subgraph B[Small-World Network]
  B1[Node] --> B2[Node]
  B2 --> B3[Node]
  B3 --> B1
end
```

**Real-World Case:** Research on **emergency response networks** showed that **scale-free networks** with high-degree hubs facilitated rapid information dissemination but were vulnerable to hub failure, while **small-world networks** offered more resilient but slower propagation.

**Countermeasures:** For scale-free networks, **add redundant connections** to hubs. For small-world networks, **increase clustering** to enhance local connectivity.

**References:** 
1. Network Centrality Measures (Visible Network Labs)

## **6. Limitations of Current Web & Semantic Web Solutions**

**Definition:** The **current web** suffers from **syntactic heterogeneity** where data lacks uniform structure, causing **integration failures** due to incompatible formats and meanings.

**Key Limitations:** **Data silos** (e.g., proprietary health records), **schema mismatches** (e.g., different field definitions), and **ambiguous semantics** (e.g., varying terminology).

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph LR
A[Legacy System] --> B{Heterogeneous Data}
C[Social Media] --> B
B --> D[Integration Failure]
B --> E[Semantic Web Solution]
E --> F[Ontology Alignment]
F --> G[Unified Data Access]
```

**Real-World Case:** A **healthcare integration project** failed because EHR systems used different standards (HL7 vs. FHIR), causing **semantic mismatches** in patient data interpretation. This led to **medication errors** and **duplicate tests**.

**Semantic Web Approach:** Use **OWL ontologies** to map terminology, **RDF** to standardize data representation, and **SPARQL** to query integrated data sources.

**Countermeasures:** Adopt **international standards** (e.g., HL7 FHIR), implement **ontology-based integration**, and use **LLMs** for schema alignment.

**References:** 
1. Semantic Interoperability in Health Records (PMC8791650)
2. Using LLMs for Semantic Interoperability (ScienceDirect)

**Practice Questions:**
