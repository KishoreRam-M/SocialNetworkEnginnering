## 🔹 Step 1: Centrality Metrics (Quick Recap)

* **Degree Centrality** → number of direct connections a node has.
* **Closeness Centrality** → how quickly a node can reach others (shortest paths).
* **Betweenness Centrality** → how often a node lies on shortest paths between others (bridge control).

## 🔹 Step 2: Two Example Structures

### 1. **Star Network**

```
     B
     |
C —  A — D
     |
     E
```

* **Degree Centrality**:

  * Node A (hub) has max degree = 4.
  * All others = 1.
* **Closeness Centrality**:

  * A has highest closeness (1 step to all).
  * Others = lower (must go through A).
* **Betweenness Centrality**:

  * A = extremely high (all shortest paths go through it).
  * Others = 0.

👉 **Result**: Very **fast information flow** (hub spreads instantly), but fragile (hub failure = collapse).

---

### 2. **Circle (Ring) Network**

```
A — B — C — D — E — A
```

* **Degree Centrality**:

  * All nodes = 2 (equal).
* **Closeness Centrality**:

  * Moderate; each node \~2 steps on average to reach others.
* **Betweenness Centrality**:

  * Distributed (some nodes bridge pairs, but no monopoly).

👉 **Result**: Slower spread (info hops around), but **robust** (no single point of failure).

## 🔹 Step 3: Comparison Table

| Metric                | Star Network                      | Circle Network               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Degree Centrality** | Hub (A) dominates, others weak    | All equal (2)                |
| **Closeness**         | Hub = highest, very fast reach    | Moderate, slower reach       |
| **Betweenness**       | Hub = extremely high (bottleneck) | Shared, balanced control     |
| **Efficiency**        | High speed, low resilience        | Lower speed, high resilience |

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Conclusion

* **Star Network** = **efficient for speed** (best when quick broadcast is critical, e.g., emergency alert).
* **Circle Network** = **efficient for resilience** (best when robustness and fairness matter, e.g., peer-to-peer sharing).

👉 So, “efficiency” depends on context:

* **Need speed?** → Star.
* **Need robustness?** → Circle.

✨ Would you like me to **draw and label a simple diagram** of both networks with centrality highlights (like hub in red, equal nodes in blue) so it’s easier to visualize for an exam or report?
