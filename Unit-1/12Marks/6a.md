# 🚧 Why the Old Web Fails at Data Integration (Simple Story)

## 🏙️ Case Study: A City Project That Failed

* The city wanted **one portal** where staff and citizens could see all information about a house or person (property, permits, licenses, emergency calls).
* They spent **18 months and ₹10 crore** (or \$1.2M), but the project was **abandoned**.

**What went wrong?**

* Same address written in many different ways → system thought they were different houses.
* Owner names mismatched across departments.
* Permit history missing or mixed up.
* Searching was unreliable.
* Staff lost trust → project shut down.

## ❌ Why Current Web/Database Methods Struggled

* **Different formats:** One dept used “addr\_line”, another used “street”.
* **No shared IDs:** No single number for a property or person → everything matched by text.
* **Data overwriting:** ETL pipelines overwrote each other’s records, hiding original info.
* **No source tracking:** Couldn’t tell which dept provided a fact.
* **Rigid design:** Adding new data (like maps or photos) was hard.
* **Maintenance nightmare:** If one dept changed format, the whole system broke.

## ✅ How the Semantic Web Would Fix This

* **Unique IDs (URIs):** Every house, person, and permit has a web-style ID.

  * Example: `http://data.city.gov/address/123-main`
* **Ontologies (shared dictionaries):** Common meanings for terms like “owner”, “parcel”, “permit”.
* **Keep original sources:** Each dept keeps its data but publishes it in linked format.
* **Provenance (who said what):** We can always see which dept gave the info and when.
* **Smart queries:** Instead of copying all data, we query it live using **SPARQL** (like SQL for the web).

## 🔍 Example (Simple)

### Old Way (failed)

* Property Dept: “123 Main Street → Owner: Anita”
* License Dept: “123 Main St → Holder: A. Rao”
* System doesn’t know Anita Rao = A. Rao.

### Semantic Web Way

* Both get a **shared ID**:

  * `ex:person/0345` = Anita Rao.
* Any query will link both records correctly.

---

## 🚀 Benefits

* Less duplication (no two “123 Main” problems).
* Always know the **source** of data.
* Easy to add new datasets in the future.
* More reliable answers for staff and public.

## 🛠️ Roadmap (Simple Steps)

1. Pick a few datasets (e.g., property + permits).
2. Give them **URIs** and publish in **RDF**.
3. Connect them with **SPARQL queries**.
4. Gradually add more depts (licenses, emergency, etc.).
5. Train staff to use and maintain the new system.
