## 1. Illustrate the Transition from the Traditional Web to the Semantic Web with Suitable Examples

**Definition:** The **transition** from the **Traditional Web** (Web 1.0) to the **Semantic Web** (Web 3.0) represents a paradigm shift from **document-centric** information to **machine-readable data** interconnected through **ontologies** and **metadata**. This evolution enables **intelligent processing** by machines rather than just human consumption.

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Traditional Web (Web 1.0) | Semantic Web (Web 3.0) |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Content Type** | Static documents | Linked data and knowledge graphs |
| **Primary Consumers** | Humans | Machines and humans |
| **Data Structure** | Unstructured HTML | Structured RDF/OWL formats |
| **Interoperability** | Limited | Enhanced through ontologies |
| **Search Mechanism** | Keyword-based | Context-aware and semantic |

**Example:** 
- **Traditional Web:** A Wikipedia page about "Apple" contains text and images that humans read to determine if it refers to the fruit or company
- **Semantic Web:** Metadata tags explicitly define whether "Apple" refers to <Apple_Fruit> or <Apple_Inc>, enabling machines to accurately process queries

**Diagram:** 
```mermaid

A[Traditional Web] --> B[HTML Documents]
B --> C[Human Interpretation]
C --> D[Limited Automation]
A --> E[Semantic Web]
E --> F[RDF/OWL Knowledge Graphs]
F --> G[Machine Reasoning]
G --> H[Advanced Data Integration]
```

**Real-World Case:** Google's **Knowledge Graph** (launched 2012) uses Semantic Web technologies to provide direct answers to queries by understanding semantic relationships between entities rather than just matching keywords.

**Countermeasures for Transition Challenges:** Use of **RDFa** to embed semantic markup in existing HTML documents, allowing gradual implementation without complete system overhauls.

## 2. The Purpose of RDF and OWL in Enabling Machine-Readable Content

**Definition:** **Resource Description Framework (RDF)** provides a standardized **data model** for representing information as **triples** (subject-predicate-object), while **Web Ontology Language (OWL)** adds **vocabulary** for defining complex **ontologies** with formal semantics, enabling **logical inference** and **knowledge reasoning**.

**Key Functions:**
- **RDF:** Creates machine-readable statements about resources (<https://example.org/John> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows> <https://example.org/Mary>)
- **OWL:** Defines formal ontologies with class hierarchies, property characteristics, and constraints

**Example:** 
In a social network context:
- **RDF** expresses: "User A follows User B"
- **OWL** defines: "If User A follows User B, and User B follows User C, then User A might know User C" (through property transitivity)

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TB
A[RDF Triples] --> B[Subject-Predicate-Object]
A --> C[Universal Data Representation]
A --> D[Linked Data Foundation]
E[OWL Ontologies] --> F[Class Definitions]
E --> G[Property Characteristics]
E --> H[Logical Constraints]
B --> I[Machine-Readable Content]
F --> I
```

**Security Implications:** Proper ontological modeling helps prevent **data misinterpretation** by systems, reducing errors in automated decision making. However, inconsistent ontologies can create **integration vulnerabilities**.

**Real-World Case:** The **Facebook Open Graph Protocol** uses RDF-like structures to define relationships between people, objects, and activities across the web, enabling consistent machine interpretation of social connections.

**Countermeasures:** Implementation of **ontology validation tools** and shared **upper ontologies** to ensure consistency across domains.

## 3. Compare the Structural Differences Between a Centralised and a Decentralised Social Network

**Definition:** **Centralized social networks** rely on a **single authority** that controls data storage and processing, while **decentralized social networks** distribute authority across **multiple nodes** using **peer-to-peer** architectures or **federated** systems.

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Centralized Networks | Decentralized Networks |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Control** | Single entity | Distributed among users |
| **Data Storage** | Central servers | Across multiple nodes |
| **Censorship Resistance** | Low | High |
| **Performance** | Typically faster | Can be slower due to replication |
| **Examples** | Facebook, Twitter | Mastodon, Diaspora |

**Example:** 
- **Centralized:** Twitter stores all tweets on its servers and controls content moderation policies globally
- **Decentralized:** Mastodon allows independent communities to host their own instances while enabling cross-instance communication through the ActivityPub protocol

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TB
subgraph Centralized
  A[Central Server] --> B[User 1]
  A --> C[User 2]
  A --> D[User 3]
end

subgraph Decentralized
  E[Instance 1] --> F[User A]
  E --> G[User B]
  H[Instance 2] --> I[User C]
  H --> J[User D]
  E <--> H
end
```

**Security Implications:** Centralized networks present **single points of failure** and are vulnerable to **mass data breaches** (e.g., Facebook Cambridge Analytica incident ). Decentralized networks reduce this risk but face challenges with **consistent content moderation** and **protocol-level vulnerabilities**.

**Real-World Case:** The **Diaspora*** social network, launched in 2010 as a response to Facebook's privacy issues, implemented a decentralized model where users control their own "pods" containing personal data.

**Countermeasures:** For decentralized networks, implementation of **end-to-end encryption** and **consensus mechanisms** for content validation across nodes.

2. Geiger, R. S. (2022). The Fediverse: A Review of Privacy and Security Features in Decentralized Social Networks.

## 4. Interpret the Role of Degree Centrality in Identifying Active Participants Within a Social Network

**Definition:** **Degree centrality** is a **network metric** that quantifies the number of **direct connections** a node has to other nodes in the network, serving as an indicator of **activity level** or **popularity** within the network structure.

**Calculation:** For a node, degree centrality = Number of direct ties to other nodes

**Example:** In a professional network like LinkedIn:
- A user with 500+ connections has high degree centrality
- A user with only 10 connections has low degree centrality
- The user with high degree centrality is likely an active participant who frequently engages with others

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph LR
A[Node A: Degree 4] --> B[Node B]
A --> C[Node C]
A --> D[Node D]
A --> E[Node E]
F[Node F: Degree 1] --> B
G[Node G: Degree 2] --> C
G --> H[Node H]
```

**Security Implications:** Nodes with **high degree centrality** can be valuable **attack targets** as compromising them would expose many connections. They can also serve as effective **trusted distributors** for security patches or warnings within the network.

**Real-World Case:** In the 2016 Twitter Bitcoin scam, hackers targeted verified accounts with high degree centrality (celebrities, politicians) to maximize the spread of their fraudulent message .

**Countermeasures:** Implement **adaptive authentication measures** for high-degree nodes and continuous monitoring of their activity patterns for anomalies.

## 5. Identify How Semantic Web Improves Knowledge Representation Over Traditional HTML-Based Web Systems

**Definition:** The **Semantic Web** enhances **knowledge representation** by adding **formal semantics** to data through **ontologies** and **structured metadata**, enabling **machine interpretation** of meaning rather than just human-readable presentation.

**Key Improvements:**

1. **Explicit Meaning**: Data is accompanied by semantic metadata defining precise meaning
2. **Interoperability**: Standardized models (RDF, OWL) enable data integration across sources
3. **Inference Capability**: Machines can derive new knowledge through logical reasoning

**Example:** 
- **HTML:** `<b>Apple</b>` presents the word with formatting but no semantic meaning
- **Semantic Web:** `<rdf:Description rdf:about="Apple"><rdf:type rdf:resource="http://ontology.com/Fruit"/></rdf:Description>` explicitly defines Apple as a fruit

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TB
subgraph Traditional HTML
  A[Presentation Focus] --> B[Human Consumption]
  A --> C[Unstructured Data]
  C --> D[Limited Automation]
end

subgraph Semantic Web
  E[Meaning Focus] --> F[Machine Consumption]
  E --> G[Structured Knowledge]
  G --> H[Advanced Reasoning]
  G --> I[Data Integration]
end
```

**Security Implications:** Semantic Web technologies enable more **precise access control policies** based on semantic relationships rather than just syntax. However, **ontology poisoning** attacks could manipulate inference results.

**Real-World Case:** The **BBC's linked data initiative** used Semantic Web technologies to create a unified knowledge base connecting content across their website, dramatically improving content discoverability and integration.

**Countermeasures:** Use of **digital signatures** for ontological definitions and **reasoning validation** mechanisms to detect inconsistent inferences.

2. GeeksforGeeks: Semantic Web vs Traditional Web

## 6. Differentiate the Concepts of Closeness Centrality and Betweenness Centrality in Network Analysis

**Definition:** **Closeness centrality** measures how **close** a node is to all other nodes in the network based on **shortest path distances**, identifying nodes that can quickly interact with the entire network. **Betweenness centrality** measures how often a node lies on the **shortest path** between other nodes, identifying nodes that act as **bridges** or **gatekeepers** between network parts.

**Calculation:**
- Closeness Centrality = 1 / sum of shortest path distances to all other nodes
- Betweenness Centrality = Σ (number of shortest paths between s and t that pass through v) / (total number of shortest paths between s and t)

**Example:** In an office communication network:
- The CEO might have high **closeness centrality** as they're directly connected to many departments
- An administrative assistant might have high **betweenness centrality** as they facilitate communication between different departments

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Node A: High Closeness] --> B[Node B]
  A --> C[Node C]
  A --> D[Node D]
  B --> E[Node E]
  C --> E
  D --> E
  F[Node F: High Betweenness] --> B
  F --> C
  F --> D
```

**Security Implications:** Nodes with high **betweenness centrality** can be critical **chokepoints** for network security—monitoring these nodes can detect intrusion attempts, while compromising them enables **eavesdropping** on communications. Nodes with high **closeness centrality** are ideal for **rapid dissemination** of security updates.

**Real-World Case:** In cybersecurity analysis of corporate networks, betweenness centrality helps identify **critical routers** that, if compromised, would allow attackers to monitor traffic between multiple network segments.

## 7. Summarize the Core Features of the Social Web That Distinguish It from the Traditional Web

**Definition:** The **Social Web** (Web 2.0) represents a fundamental shift from **static consumption** to **dynamic participation**, characterized by **user-generated content**, **social interactions**, and **collaborative creation** that distinguishes it from the passive consumption model of the Traditional Web (Web 1.0).

**Key Distinguishing Features:**

1. **User-Generated Content**: Users create and share content rather than just consuming it
2. **Network Effects**: Value increases with more users and interactions
3. **Rich Interactions**: Comments, likes, shares, and other social engagements
4. **Collaborative Creation**: Wikis, collaborative filtering, and collective intelligence
5. **Platform Economy**: APIs enable third-party innovations atop core platforms

**Example:** 
- **Traditional Web:** CNN.com publishing news articles for readers to consume
- **Social Web:** Twitter allowing users to create tweets, retweet others, and follow conversations

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph Traditional Web
  A[Publishers] --> B[Create Content]
  B --> C[Users Consume]
end

subgraph Social Web
  D[Users] --> E[Create Content]
  D --> F[Interact with Content]
  F --> G[Share with Network]
  G --> H[Community Formation]
end
```

**Security Implications:** The Social Web introduces **new attack vectors** including **social engineering**, **identity theft**, and **viral misinformation**. Privacy concerns escalate as users voluntarily share personal information that can be **aggregated** and **exploited**.

**Real-World Case:** The **Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal** (2018) demonstrated how social web features (APIs, data sharing, network effects) could be exploited to harvest personal data of millions of users without consent for political advertising .

**Countermeasures:** Implementation of **granular privacy controls**, **audit trails** for data access, and **user education** on data sharing practices.

2. Zimmer, M. (2008). The Externalities of Web 2.0: On the Convergence of Great Promise and Great Risk.

## 8. The Significance of Ontologies in Achieving Interoperability in Web-Based Systems to Be Discussed with Relevant Details

**Definition:** **Ontologies** provide formal, explicit specifications of **shared conceptualizations** that enable **interoperability** between web-based systems by establishing common **vocabularies**, **semantic relationships**, and **logical frameworks** for consistent information exchange across heterogeneous platforms.

**Key Functions for Interoperability:**

1. **Vocabulary Alignment**: Establishing common terms and definitions
2. **Semantic Mapping**: Defining relationships between concepts from different sources
3. **Logic Consistency**: Ensuring integrated information doesn't create contradictions
4. **Knowledge Inference**: Enabling derivation of new knowledge from integrated data

**Example:** In healthcare systems, an ontology can reconcile differences between:
- System A: "Myocardial Infarction" 
- System B: "Heart Attack"
- System C: "MI"
By defining all terms as equivalent in a medical ontology

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TB
subgraph Without Ontology
  A[System A] --> B[Vocabulary Mismatch]
  C[System B] --> B
  D[System C] --> B
  B --> E[Integration Failure]
end

subgraph With Ontology
  F[System A] --> G[Ontology Mapping]
  H[System B] --> G
  I[System C] --> G
  G --> J[Seamless Interoperability]
end
```

**Security Implications:** Proper ontological alignment enables **secure data integration** with preserved meaning across systems. However, **ontology manipulation** attacks could deliberately create misinterpretations during data exchange.

**Real-World Case:** The **National Cancer Institute Thesaurus** ontology enables interoperability between diverse cancer research databases, clinical systems, and research institutions by providing standardized definitions of cancer-related terms and relationships.

**Countermeasures:** Use of **digitally signed ontologies**, **ontology versioning systems**, and **consistency checkers** to ensure ontological integrity across systems.

## 9. Demonstrate the Influence of Social Media Networks on Shaping Public Opinion During Elections

**Definition:** **Social media networks** significantly influence **public opinion** during elections through **algorithmic content curation**, **targeted messaging**, **information cascades**, and **network effects** that shape voter perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors at unprecedented scale and speed.

**Key Influence Mechanisms:**

1. **Selective Exposure**: Algorithms create echo chambers by showing content that aligns with users' existing views
2. **Agenda Setting**: Platforms determine which issues receive attention through trending topics and recommendations
3. **Microtargeting**: Political ads tailored to specific demographic and psychographic profiles
4. **Opinion Leadership**: Influencers shape perceptions within their networks

**Example:** During the 2020 U.S. elections, campaign strategies heavily relied on social media platforms for:
- Voter mobilization through targeted messaging
- Dissemination of campaign materials
- Countering opposition narratives
- Encouraging voter registration and turnout

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph LR

B --> C[Platform Algorithms]
C --> D[Personalized Feeds]
D --> E[Selective Exposure]
E --> F[Echo Chambers]
F --> G[Opinion Formation]
G --> H[Voting Behavior]
```

**Security Implications:** Social media enables **foreign interference** through coordinated inauthentic behavior, **microtargeted disinformation**, and **deepfake propaganda**. The 2016 U.S. elections demonstrated how social media could be weaponized to influence democratic processes .

**Real-World Case:** The **Cambridge Analytica scandal** revealed how personal data from millions of Facebook users was used to create psychological profiles and deliver microtargeted political advertising during the 2016 U.S. presidential election and Brexit referendum .

**Countermeasures:** **Transparency in political advertising**, **algorithmic accountability**, **digital literacy education**, and **cross-platform collaboration** to detect coordinated manipulation campaigns.

## 10. Distinguish Between Structural Holes and Bridges in the Context of Social Network Connectivity

**Definition:** **Structural holes** are gaps between **non-redundant contacts** in a network where there is an absence of connection, creating opportunities for **information brokerage**. **Bridges** are single ties that **connect two otherwise separated clusters** in a network, serving as crucial pathways for information flow between groups.

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Structural Holes | Bridges |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| **Definition** | Gap between disconnected clusters | Specific connection spanning clusters |
| **Focus** | Position of broker between groups | Specific tie connecting groups |
| **Measurement** | Constraint coefficient | Edge betweenness |
| **Benefit** | Information control and innovation | Information flow and diffusion |

**Example:** In an organizational network:
- A **structural hole** exists between the R&D and Marketing departments if they have no direct connections
- A **bridge** would be a specific employee who has connections to both departments

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TB
  subgraph Cluster A
    A[Node A] --> B[Node B]
    A --> C[Node C]
  end
  
  subgraph Cluster B
    D[Node D] --> E[Node E]
    D --> F[Node F]
  end
  
  subgraph Cluster C
    G[Node G] --> H[Node H]
    G --> I[Node I]
  end
  
  B -- Bridge --> D
  C -- Bridge --> G
  
  style Cluster A fill:#f9f
  style Cluster B fill:#9ff
  style Cluster C fill:#ff9
```

**Security Implications:** Nodes spanning structural holes can become **critical security gatekeepers** but also **single points of failure**. Bridges can be exploited as **vulnerable pathways** for cross-network contamination during cyber attacks.

**Real-World Case:** Ronald Burt's study of supply chain managers found that those who bridged structural holes were more likely to receive positive performance evaluations, higher compensation, and faster promotions .

**Countermeasures:** **Redundant bridging connections** to avoid single points of failure and **monitoring bridge traffic** for anomalous cross-network activity.

## 11. Analyze a Scenario Where Information Flow in a Network Is Disrupted and Propose a Structural Solution

**Definition:** **Information flow disruption** occurs when **network pathways** are blocked or degraded, preventing efficient communication between nodes. **Structural solutions** involve modifying **network topology** to create alternative pathways and enhance **robustness** against such disruptions.

**Scenario Analysis:** A natural disaster damages key communication infrastructure in a regional emergency response network, creating **information bottlenecks** that prevent coordination between first responders.

**Structural Problems:**
1. **Over-reliance** on centralized communication towers
2. **Lack of redundant pathways** between critical nodes
3. **Network fragmentation** into isolated components

**Proposed Structural Solutions:**

1. **Mesh Network Topology**: Create multiple interconnected pathways for redundant communication
2. **Decentralized Hubs**: Distribute critical functions across multiple nodes
3. **Mobile Bridge Nodes**: Deploy portable communication units to reconnect fragmented components

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph Fragmented Network After Disaster
  A[Team A] --> B[Team B]
  C[Team C] --> D[Team D]
  E[Team E] --> F[Team F]
  style A fill:#f9f
  style B fill:#f9f
  style C fill:#9ff
  style D fill:#9ff
  style E fill:#ff9
  style F fill:#ff9
end

subgraph Restored Network with Structural Solutions
  G[Team A] --> H[Team B]
  G --> I[Mesh Node 1]
  H --> I

  J --> K
  K --> L[Mobile Bridge]
  J --> L
  K --> L
  L --> M[Team E]
  L --> N[Team F]
  M --> N
end
```

**Security Implications:** Structural solutions must balance **redundancy** with **security**—increasing pathways also expands the **attack surface**. Implementation of **encryption** and **access control** across all redundant pathways is essential.

**Real-World Case:** Following Hurricane Katrina's communication failures, emergency response networks implemented **mesh network technologies** with **mobile ad-hoc capabilities** to maintain connectivity during infrastructure outages.

## 12. Associate the Key Stages in the Development of Social Network Analysis with Modern Research Applications

**Definition:** The **historical development** of Social Network Analysis (SNA) progressed through distinct stages from **theoretical foundations** to **computational analytics**, enabling modern applications across diverse domains from public health to cybersecurity.

**Key Developmental Stages:**

1. **Theoretical Foundations** (1930s-1950s): Jacob Moreno's sociograms, Kurt Lewin's field theory
2. **Mathematical Formalization** (1960s-1970s): Graph theory applications, centrality measures
3. **Computational Expansion** (1980s-1990s): Computer-enabled analysis of larger networks
4. **Digital Revolution** (2000s-2010s): Online social networks, big data analytics
5. **AI Integration** (2020s-present): Machine learning, predictive modeling

**Modern Research Applications:**

- **Public Health**: Contact tracing for epidemic control 
- **Counterterrorism**: Identifying key nodes in terrorist networks

## 13. Outline the Implications of Privacy Concerns in Data Sharing Across Social Platforms

**Definition:** **Privacy concerns** in social platform data sharing encompass issues of **consent violation**, **data aggregation**, **secondary usage**, and **surveillance capitalism**, creating risks of **identity theft**, **discrimination**, and **manipulation** that undermine user autonomy and trust.

**Key Implications:**

1. **Individual Impacts**: Identity theft, reputational damage, psychological distress
2. **Societal Impacts**: Chilling effects on free expression, erosion of trust in digital institutions
3. **Democratic Impacts**: Manipulation of voter behavior, undermining of electoral integrity
4. **Economic Impacts**: Uneven value distribution between platforms and users whose data generates value

**Example:** When users agree to a social platform's terms of service, they typically grant broad permissions for:
- Collection of extensive personal data
- Tracking across other websites and apps
- Data sharing with third parties
- Use of data for targeted advertising

**Diagram:**
```mermaid

B --> F[Surveillance Capitalism]
C --> G[Individual Risks]
D --> G
E --> G
F --> G
G --> H[Identity Theft]
G --> I[Discrimination]
G --> J[Manipulation]
```

**Security Implications:** Privacy violations create **expanded attack surfaces** for malicious actors through **data aggregation breaches**. The **Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal** demonstrated how apparently innocuous data could be combined into powerful psychological profiling tools .

**Real-World Case:** In 2021, LinkedIn faced scrutiny after data from 700 million users (92% of its user base) was scraped and offered for sale on dark web markets, demonstrating how even professional social networks face significant data protection challenges.

**Countermeasures:** Implementation of **privacy-by-design principles**, **differential privacy techniques**, **federated learning**, and **stronger regulatory frameworks** like GDPR and CCPA.

## 14. Examine the Role of Historical Privacy Paradigms in Shaping Current Online Data Protection Policies

**Definition:** **Historical privacy paradigms**—including **Warren and Brandeis's "Right to be Let Alone"** (1890), **Westin's Information Self-Determination** (1967), and **Nissenbaum's Contextual Integrity** (2004)—have fundamentally shaped modern data protection policies by establishing philosophical foundations for digital privacy rights.

**Key Paradigm Influences:**

1. **Right to Privacy** (1890): Established privacy as a legal concept influencing later data protection laws
2. **Fair Information Practice Principles** (1970s): Provided framework for modern privacy regulations
3. **Privacy as Contextual Integrity** (2004): Recognized that privacy norms vary across social contexts

**Example:** The European Union's **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** incorporates elements from multiple historical paradigms:
- **Right to be forgotten** from the Right to Privacy paradigm
- **Purpose limitation** from FIPPs
- **Context-appropriate protections** from Contextual Integrity

**Diagram:**
```mermaid

```

**Security Implications:** Modern data protection regulations like GDPR create **security requirements** including **data encryption**, **breach notification**, and **privacy-by-design** that significantly impact how organizations implement cybersecurity measures.

**Real-World Case:** The **EU-US Privacy Shield** framework (invalidated in 2020) attempted to reconcile different privacy paradigms between European and American approaches, demonstrating ongoing tensions between privacy as fundamental right versus market commodity.

**Countermeasures:** Organizations should implement **privacy impact assessments**, **data minimization strategies**, and **context-aware access controls** to comply with evolving regulatory frameworks inspired by these historical paradigms.

## 15. Apply Network Analysis Concepts to Assess the Vulnerability of a Communication Network During a Cyberattack

**Definition:** **Network analysis concepts** including **centrality measures**, **connectivity metrics**, and **community structure** provide systematic frameworks for assessing **cyberattack vulnerability** by identifying critical nodes, fragile connections, and structural weaknesses in communication networks.

**Assessment Framework:**

1. **Identify Critical Assets**: Map network components and their importance
2. **Analyze Network Topology**: Calculate centrality measures and connectivity patterns
3. **Model Attack Scenarios**: Simulate various cyberattack approaches
4. **Quantify Impact**: Measure potential damage from successful attacks

**Example:** Assessing a corporate network for vulnerability to a **DDoS attack**:
- Use **degree centrality** to identify highly connected routers that could be overwhelmed
- Apply **betweenness centrality** to find critical bridges whose failure would fragment the network
- Analyze **community structure** to determine if segmentation could contain damage

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TB
subgraph Network Vulnerability Assessment
  A[Network Mapping] --> B[Topology Analysis]
  B --> C[Centrality Calculation]

end

subgraph Attack Simulation
  H[Cyberattack Scenario] --> I[Node Removal]
  I --> J[Cascade Failure]
  J --> K[Impact Assessment]
  K --> L[Risk Prioritization]
end

G --> L
```

**Security Implications:** Network analysis helps prioritize **security resource allocation** to protect most critical nodes. However, attackers can use similar techniques to **identify valuable targets**, creating an arms race in network analysis capabilities.

**Real-World Case:** The 2015 **Ukraine power grid cyberattack** demonstrated how attackers could use network analysis to identify critical control systems whose compromise would cause maximum disruption .

**Countermeasures:** Implement **network redundancy** for critical nodes, **segmentation** to limit cascade failures, and **dynamic topology reconfiguration** capabilities to adapt during attacks.
